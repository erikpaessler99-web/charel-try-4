# Rosie Component Library

This folder contains **pre-built Rosie components** that you can use or not, depending on your use case.
These are production-ready, tested components - but only use them if they fit the specific request.

## 🚨 Important: Always Read Before Using

**You must use the `read` tool to load a component's source code BEFORE importing it.**

Example workflow:
```javascript
// 1. Use read tool first
read(file_path="/rosie/controls/rosieControls.js")

// 2. Then import after reviewing
import { PlayerController } from './rosie/controls/rosieControls.js';
```

## Available Components

### 🎮 rosieControls.js

**Path:** `/rosie/controls/rosieControls.js`
**Exports:** `PlayerController`, `ThirdPersonCameraController`, `FirstPersonCameraController`

**What it does:**
- WASD movement with camera-relative direction
- Jumping, gravity, ground detection
- Third-person orbiting camera OR first-person pointer-lock
- Automatic mobile controls (virtual joystick + buttons)

**Use for:** 3D platformers, exploration games, action games
**Don't use for:** 2D games, racing games, top-down games

**Quick example:**
```javascript
const controller = new PlayerController(playerMesh, {
  moveSpeed: 10,
  jumpForce: 15,
  groundLevel: 0
});

const camera = new ThirdPersonCameraController(
  camera, playerMesh, renderer.domElement, {
  distance: 7,
  height: 3
});

// In game loop:
const rotation = camera.update();
controller.update(deltaTime, rotation);
```
